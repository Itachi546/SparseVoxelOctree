### Raycasting the Sparse Octree ☐

Implement the raycasting of sparse octree in the gpu. This should includes all the optimization we have previously skipped from before.

### Beam optimization ☐

Implement beam optimization for acceleration of the primary ray

### Smooth and Sharp Normals ☐
Now supports only the smooth normal

### Global Illumination ☐
Should support temporal filtering, along with soft shadow and AO

### Editing Sparse Octree ☐
Editing voxels
